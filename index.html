                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p> Greetings, dear readers. I am Maveli, a name that carries the echoes of a bygone era in the lush 
                    and enchanting land of Kerala. Allow me to take you on a journey through time, to a period when
                    I ruled Kerala with a heart brimming with benevolence and a vision of harmony.
                </p>
                <p>In the annals of Kerala's history, my name is synonymous with justice, prosperity, and the 
                    enduring spirit of our people. During my reign, Kerala experienced a golden age, marked by 
                    fairness, equity, and the well-being of my beloved subjects. Their happiness and welfare were
                    my unwavering focus, and under my rule, Kerala knew no suffering.
                </p>

            <!-- <p>
                My story is one intertwined with legend and myth. As the tale goes, my growing power and popularity 
                raised concerns among the gods, particularly Lord Vishnu. To humble me, Lord Vishnu assumed the form
                of Vamana, a dwarf Brahmin, and requested three paces of land as a boon. I granted this humble request,
                but to my surprise, Vamana expanded to cover the entire universe in three steps. Thus, I was humbled and
                pushed to the netherworld. However, in recognition of my virtues and love for my people, Lord Vishnu granted 
                me a special boon. I was allowed to visit my beloved kingdom and people once a year during the grand festival 
                of Onam.
